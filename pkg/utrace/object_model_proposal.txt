Options
---
PIDs: Find all binaries associated to these PIDs. uprobe is placed on a binary associated to these PIDs (loaded from proc maps)

BINARY: Associate uprobe to binary (no filter on PID unless explicitely given in other option).

EXECUTABLE: Find all PIDs that run these executable, load all binaries associated. Allow to probe on all these binaries.

Note:
- PIDs and EXECUTABLE are mutually exclusive (for now at least)
- BINARY if specified takes precedence on where we want to place the uprobe

Function pattern is associated to one of the options above.
example : --binary "libc malloc" --executable "exec1 fopen"
TODO : find a separator


FuncID 
--- 
Represents the function being probed (uprobe and retprobe have the same ID)
Proposal: change to TracedFuncID ?


TracedBinary
---
contains a file 
pid list: this is not stored at the right place. Proposal : create a trace context structure.
contains a symbol cache tied this file. Warning: addresses need to be independant from PID
symbolNameToFuncID : issue. Malloc is available in several libraries. 
Malloc has several IDs, a symbol name can match several IDs
TBD : what do we do of this ?
